# Acknowledgement:
We have referenced the following resources when implementing our chat system:

1. Building your first Chat Application using Flask in 7Â minutes
URL: https://codeburst.io/building-your-first-chat-application-using-flask-in-7-minutes-f98de4adfa5d
Github: https://github.com/samhita-alla/flask-chat-app-article

2. Flask-Login
URL: https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

3. Flask-SocketIO
URL: https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

We have borrowed some ideas from the resources listed above. For example, how the first reference arranges elements
at its front end. However, we have overwritten the entire logic and included many new features as well.


# Environment Setup:
We use XAMPP while developing our toy chat system on macOS Mojave Version 10.14.3. Due to the extensive use of SQL queries
and database in our chat system, please let us know if you have problem setting up the database environment and replicating
the results we get. As for what each file in this project is for, please see our project report. Thanks.
